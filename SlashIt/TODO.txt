TODO

-- Change all locations to be relative to the map instead of relative to the console
-- Come up with better strategy for handling key input.
-- Commands (like save, quit, doOpen) should be refactored.  Maybe the command pattern?


Longer Term

-- Could use encryption with differing keys on the uniqueId's stored in the map matrix and on the NPC's theirselves
   to make it hard to hack.  Give it a try!!
