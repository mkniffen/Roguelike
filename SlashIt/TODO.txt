TODO

-- Display new equipment list with modified slot highlighted (and maybe some text to say what was taken off)
-- Optimize map drawing
-- Change commands to singletons...



Longer Term

-- Could use encryption with differing keys on the uniqueId's stored in the map matrix and on the NPC's theirselves
   to make it hard to hack.  Give it a try!!
