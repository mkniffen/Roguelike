TODO

-- Refactor game loop
   -- Add some simple mob AI and determine how the main loop should be redone
   -- Check bounds needs to be done differently
-- Find a good way to store variable info on mobs and objects.  Would be nice if it could be generic
-- Come up with better strategy for handling key input.
-- Commands (like save, quit, doOpen) should be refactored.  Maybe the command pattern?


Longer Term

-- Could use encryption with differing keys on the uniqueId's stored in the map matrix and on the NPC's theirselves
   to make it hard to hack.  Give it a try!!
