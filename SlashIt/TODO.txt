TODO

-- Find a good way to store variable info on mobs and objects.  Would be nice if it could be generic
-- Redo Save/Load
-- Optimize map drawing
-- Change commands to singletons...



Longer Term

-- Could use encryption with differing keys on the uniqueId's stored in the map matrix and on the NPC's theirselves
   to make it hard to hack.  Give it a try!!
